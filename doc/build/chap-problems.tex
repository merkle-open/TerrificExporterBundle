\section{Known Problems}
During the complexity of a project and this exporter there will always some constructs which are problematic and which the exporter won't export. Some of the currently known limitations are written down here.

\subsection{Module command with parameter set by the controller}

\subsection{Methods that returns a response rather than connect a view with @Template()}

\subsection{Assets with the path and name but different content within the same export}

\subsection{Asset usage commands within parent templates}

\subsection{Templates engines other than Twig}
